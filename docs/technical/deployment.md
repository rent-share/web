# Deployment from AWS
Integrating your web application with AWS involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide for a basic integration using AWS services. In this example, we'll cover setting up an S3 bucket for static content (like images), deploying a simple web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and configuring a domain with AWS Route 53.

### 1. **Create an S3 Bucket for Static Content:**

#### a. Create an S3 Bucket:
1. Go to the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Click on "Create bucket."
3. Choose a globally unique bucket name and select a region close to Nepal.
4. Configure other settings (versioning, logging, permissions) as needed and create the bucket.

#### b. Upload Static Content:
1. Inside your bucket, upload static content (e.g., images, CSS files) by clicking on "Upload."
2. Make sure to set the appropriate permissions for public access if needed.

### 2. **Deploy a Simple Web Application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**

#### a. Create a Simple Web Application:
1. Prepare a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js or Python app) with necessary files.
2. Ensure that your application is version-controlled (using Git, for example).

#### b. Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
1. Go to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).
2. Click on "Create Application."
3. Choose a unique name for your application, select the platform (Node.js, Python, etc.), and configure other settings.
4. Upload your application code or provide the URL to your version-controlled repository.
5. Click on "Create application."

### 3. **Configure a Domain with AWS Route 53:**

#### a. Register a Domain (if you haven't already):
1. Go to the [AWS Route 53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/).
2. Click on "Register Domain."
3. Follow the steps to register your domain.

#### b. Configure Domain in Route 53:
1. In the Route 53 dashboard, click on "Hosted zones."
2. Create a new hosted zone with your domain name.
3. Note the Name Servers provided by Route 53.

#### c. Update Domain's Name Servers:
1. In the domain registrar's (where you registered the domain) dashboard, update the domain's Name Servers with the ones provided by Route 53.

#### d. Configure Route 53 Record Sets:
1. Inside your hosted zone in Route 53, create an "A" record to point to the Elastic Beanstalk environment's URL.
2. Optionally, create a "CNAME" record for www to redirect to the main domain.

### 4. **Enable HTTPS (Optional):**

#### a. Obtain SSL/TLS Certificate:
1. Go to the [AWS Certificate Manager Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/).
2. Request a certificate for your domain.

#### b. Configure Load Balancer (if using Elastic Beanstalk):
1. In the Elastic Beanstalk environment, go to the "Configuration" section.
2. Under "Load Balancer," edit the listener and select the obtained SSL/TLS certificate.

### 5. **Final Checks:**

1. **Testing:**
	- Test your web application using the domain (HTTP/HTTPS) to ensure proper integration.

2. **Monitoring and Scaling:**
	- Configure monitoring and auto-scaling settings based on your application's needs.

3. **Cost Monitoring:**
	- Regularly monitor your AWS costs and adjust resources as needed.

4. **Backup and Recovery:**
	- Set up backup and recovery mechanisms for critical data.

This example provides a basic guide for integrating a web application with AWS. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to explore additional AWS services and configurations. Always follow AWS best practices for security and optimization.

## Docker Swarm in AWS
Deploying a Docker Swarm on AWS involves several steps, including creating EC2 instances, setting up Docker, initializing the Swarm, and deploying services. Below is a step-by-step guide to deploying the Docker Swarm you've previously built on AWS:

### Prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account:**
	- Ensure you have an active AWS account.

2. **Access Key and Secret Key:**
	- Obtain AWS access key ID and secret access key with the necessary permissions.

3. **AWS CLI:**
	- Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on your local machine.

### Steps to Deploy Docker Swarm on AWS:

#### 1. **Launch EC2 Instances:**
- Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to launch EC2 instances. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports Docker, like Amazon Linux or Ubuntu.

#### 2. **Install Docker:**
- Connect to each EC2 instance using SSH.
- Install Docker on each instance:

	```bash
	sudo yum update -y  # For Amazon Linux
	sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
	sudo service docker start
	sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user  # Add user to docker group
	```

- Repeat these steps for each EC2 instance in your Swarm.

#### 3. **Initialize Docker Swarm:**
- Choose one of the instances as the Swarm manager and initialize the Swarm:

	```bash
	docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_PRIVATE_IP>
	```

- Copy the command provided in the output to join worker nodes.

#### 4. **Join Worker Nodes:**
- On each worker node, use the command copied in the previous step to join the Swarm:

	```bash
	docker swarm join --token <SWARM_TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:2377
	```

#### 5. **Deploy Services:**
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file describing your services.
- Deploy services using `docker stack deploy`:

	```bash
	docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-swarm-stack
	```

#### 6. **Access Services:**
- Access your services through the public IP or domain of the manager node on the exposed ports.

### Additional Considerations:

1. **Security Groups:**
	- Ensure that the security groups associated with your EC2 instances allow traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., port 2377 for Docker Swarm management).

2. **Load Balancing (Optional):**
	- If your services require load balancing, consider using AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) or an application load balancer.

3. **Automate Deployment:**
	- Consider using AWS CloudFormation or other automation tools to streamline the deployment process.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
	- Implement monitoring and logging solutions to keep track of the health and performance of your Docker Swarm.

5. **Scaling:**
	- AWS Auto Scaling can be used to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

6. **Backups and Recovery:**
	- Implement backup and recovery mechanisms for your application data.

7. **Cost Monitoring:**
	- Regularly monitor your AWS costs and optimize resources as needed.

Remember to replace placeholders such as `<MANAGER_PRIVATE_IP>`, `<SWARM_TOKEN>`, `<MANAGER_IP>`, and adjust security settings based on your specific setup. The steps provided assume a basic setup, and your deployment may require additional configurations based on your application's requirements.
